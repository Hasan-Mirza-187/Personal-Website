        <p className="px-3 pt-6 text-justify">
          I am an electronics engineer and web developer with a passion for
          creating innovative digital solutions. With expertise in NextJS,
          Tailwind, and TypeScript, I thrive on building dynamic and visually
          appealing websites that deliver exceptional user experiences.

          Beyond my technical prowess, I have a hidden talent that brings
          sweetness to livesâ€” I am an enthusiastic baker! I run a home-based
          baking business where I pour my creativity and love for confectionery
          into crafting delectable treats. From artisanal cakes to mouthwatering
          pastries, I take pride in infusing my creations with a sprinkle of
          joy.
        </p>
        <p className="px-3 pt-6  text-justify">
          Combining my engineering mindset with my baking passion, I strive to
          bring the same level of precision, attention to detail, and creativity
          to both domains. Whether I am tackling complex coding challenges or
          perfecting the balance of flavors in a new recipe, I approach each
          endeavor with enthusiasm, dedication, and a hunger for excellence.
